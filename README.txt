-- OPTIMAL BRUNCH --

Optimal Brunch allows a user to find the most convenient place to meet a friend for brunch (or drinks, dinner, etc). It does so by geocoding two addresses, then finding a region that takes both parties a similar amount of time to travel to, and then finally querying Factual for appropriate destinations.

The meeting will not necessarily be the geographic center between two points; it will instead be calculated by analyzing travel times returned from the Google Maps API.
